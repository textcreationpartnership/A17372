            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>So by the gouernement and defence of the holy ghoſt, nothing ſhall happen to mee, but as my ſauiour Chriſt Ieſus, appointeth (and ſuffereth).</hi>

               <p>For our playner vnderſtanding of the power of the holy ghoſt: behold the ſun in the firmament (beeing one thinge in ſubſtaunce) how all thinges in the world haue of the light and heate therof. Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull much more (and more then any tongue can expreſſe) dooth the power and vertue of the holy ſpirite of God, ſpread ouer the whole world, to gouerne and rule the ſame. Whatſoeuer benefits wee receiue from Chriſt: the ſame is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto euery of vs, by the working of the holy ghoſt.</p>
               <p>(The wicked haue ſome giftes of the holy ghoſt: as Iudas and others, haue had the gifts of knowledge. But they had not the gifte of ſanctification, regeneration, faith and conuerſion).</p>

               <p>(B) So I beleeue in God the Father; God the Sonne; &amp; God the holy Ghoſt:<note place="margin">Of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</note> and yet not three Gods, but one God.

And yet the Almightie power and Godheade of the Sonne, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, was then alſo at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before all worldes, and all one in ſubſtaunce: all three beeing the whole incomprehenſible diuine ſubſtance: and yet the ſame ſubſtance is not diuided.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:10135:16"/> The ſame twoo natures Vnited to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, wee call Chriſt: who is God and man.</p>
               <p>(c) The vertue and almightie power<note place="margin">The holy ghoſt.</note> which proceedeth from Chriſt, working his good pleaſure: the ſame is God the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>(As the ſpirit of man which is in man is of the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of man: So the ſpirit of God, which is in God; is of the eſſence and ſubſtance of God: and with God before the creation of the worldes).</p>
               <p>So wee bee compelled by the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an veritie to acknowledge euery perſon by himſelfe to be God &amp; Lord. And yet not three Gods, nor three Lordes. For in this Trinitie none is before, nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter other: none is greater, nor leſſer then another: but the whole three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be coeternall together &amp; coequall. The vnitie in Trinitie, and the Trinitie, in vnitie; is to be worſhipped. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that wilbe ſaued muſt thus think of the Trinity. And beleue and confes, that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God, is God and man. God of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Father begotten before the worldes: and man of the ſubſtaunce of

<pb facs="tcp:10135:43"/> Baptiſme, water: and in the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, bread and wine): The ſeconde is, the wordes of the Lords ordinance. And the third is, The thing ſignified by them. The thing ſignified is Chriſt: for he is the ſubſtance of all Sacraments, and they doe promiſe nothing without him: For by Chriſt is the mercie of God and ſaluation giuen vnto vs.</p>
            <p>Our Sauiour Chriſt for the ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of our fayth, hath ordeyned the preaching of the Goſpell. And for the further encreaſing and confirming of our fayth: hath inſtituted and left to be vſed of vs for euer (ſo long as wee are in this world) the twoo Sacraments (afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayde) Baptiſme, and the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: to be teſtimonies of his grace and ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Theſe are called the Sacraments of the newe Teſtament, becauſe Chriſt did inſtitute them; and left them to be vſed of all Chriſtians. And none other are to be vſed of vs as Sacraments, but thoſe onely.</p>

And further, by receyuing them, wee teſtifie our profeſsion before men: that wee are Chriſtians; not Infidels.<note place="margin">Acts 10, 47.</note> And by them wee binde our ſelues to God to followe godlineſſe (in fayth and<note place="margin">Rom. 6, 3, 4.
